# Hi, I'm Hilla ðŸ‘‹

**This GitHub repository contains my personal Data, Cloud and Software Engineering projects.**

:rocket: I started a new career chapter as an engineer after 7+ years researching and producing documentaries for TV and film.

:hammer: I'm a maker and creator who finds satisfaction in building things and making them work.

:books: Continuous learning is my way-of-life.

:flashlight: I'm an information excavator - I dig for facts and the stories they tell us.

:dart: Finding solutions to sticky problems brings me the greatest joy.
